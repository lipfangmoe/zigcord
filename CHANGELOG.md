# v0.7.0

 * **breaking**: the gateway's ReadEventData union fields have been renamed to be snake_case instead of UpperCamelCase
   * this is more consistent with how union fields are traditionally named
   * migration: rename to use snake_case. For instance:
        ```
        const event = try client.readEvent();
        defer event.deinit();
        switch (event.event) {
            // OLD: .InteractionCreate => |interaction_create| { ... }
            .interaction_create => |interaction_create| { ... }
        }
        ```
 * ReadEventData is now hand-typed instead of generated by comptime
   * this allows IDEs to be able to read types much easier
   * this also is much more human-readable as well, apologies for anyone who had to look at that :)
 * EndpointClient (generated file) now has a stable order, so diffs won't be gigantic when
   the file is generated from different platforms

# v0.6.0

 * **breaking(?)**: fixes an issue where EndpointClient methods which allowed uploading files did not work properly
   * this is only questionably a breaking change because affected methods used to panic.
   * these methods now require you supply a `zigcord.rest.Upload` instead of an `*std.Io.Reader` for the file.
   * this involves specifying both the filename and content-type of the file.
   * Noteworthy that `zigcord.rest.Upload` contains several functions to allow easily creating uploads
     * `.fromBytes(filename: []const u8, content_type: []const u8, bytes: []const u8)`
     * `.fromFileReader(filename: []const u8, content_type: []const u8, file_reader: *std.fs.File.Reader)`
     * `.fromReaderWithSize(filename: []const u8, content_type: []const u8, reader: *std.Io.Reader, size: u64)`
     * `.fromUnsizedReader(filename: []const u8, content_type: []const u8, reader: *std.Io.Reader)`
       * Noteworthy that this last method should be avoided if at all possible, as this forces transfer_encoding to be
         `chunked`, which can be undesirable since `content_length` is much simpler (also, it seems Discord may have
         an issue with how Zig encodes chunked requests, but it may be user-error) 
 * **breaking**: low-level function `setupMultipartRequest` no longer accepts a list of extra headers.
   you will need to use `setupRequest` if you want access to extra headers (other than audit log reason, detailed next).
 * new low-level function: `setupMultipartRequestWithAuditLogReason` to allow for easy mutlipart
   requests with the `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header set.
 * **breaking**: renames low-level function `requestWithValueBody` to `requestWithJsonBody`
